Before Gaurd-Clause:
```public void CreateUser(string userName, string password){
  if (userName == null){
    // Do something...}
  else{
    // Do something else...
    if (password == null){
      // Do something...}
    else{
      // Do something else...}}}```
      
After Gaurd-Clause:
```public void CreateUser(string userName, string password){
  if (userName == null)
    throw new NullArgumentException(nameof(userName));
  if (password == null)
    throw new NullArgumentException(nameof(password));
  // Do something...}```
 
What is Gaurd-Clause?
A guard clause is a technique derived from the fail-fast method whose purpose is to validate a condition and immediately stop the code execution if the condition is not met by throwing a meaningful error instead of leaving the program to throw a deeper and less meaningful error.

Why Gaurd Clause?
Guard clauses simplify code by removing useless nested branching conditions, by returning meaningful errors.
